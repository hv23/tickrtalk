But not since [Penn State](team://ncaa_basketball/penn_st_nittany_lions) was admitted into the [Big Ten](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_ten) has anything official been released.&nbsp; With that, below is the definitive article on the topic.\n\nAnd even though this is a basketball blog, I will focus on the BCS aspect of realignment to argue my points. I will discuss basketball, though, and all points held for football can loosely translate over to hoops as well.\n\nCurrently there are six BCS conferences and those 6 all get automatic BCS-bowl bids. Those conferences are [Big East](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_east), SEC, Big 10, [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12), [Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10), [ACC](conference://ncaa_basketball/acc). Of those six, three of the conferences have enough football teams to have a conference championship game (the [Big East](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_east) would have enough if more of their charter schools had D1 football programs).\n\nPart of the BCS issue is that you have some conferences without 12 schools, who don't currently have conference championship games. Adding conference championship games will ultimately help the BCS by crowing, on a field, a true conference champ. This will help with BCS bowl bids, and especially the BCS championship game. (Think of a rule where you have to at least win your division to get a BCS bid.\n\nThe other BCS issue is of the non-BCS schools and where they should lie. My realignment program take that into account.\n\nWithout further ado, after The Jump is the Big12Hoops.com Realignment plan.\n\n[MIZZOU](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers) MOVES TO THE BIG 10 .\n\nWhy is this good for the Big 10? By admitting [Mizzou](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers) into the Big 10, the Big 10 would secure a coveted TV market, namely St Louis. They would also get a share of the Kansas City TV market. By expanding westward, revenues from the Big 10 Network and apparel sales would grow. The Big 10 would also secure a 12 th team and legitimize a conference championship game. The divisions would be as follow:\n\nBig 10 East: [Ohio State](team://ncaa_basketball/ohio_st_buckeyes), Michigan, [Michigan State](team://ncaa_basketball/michigan_st_spartans), Indiana, [Purdue](team://ncaa_basketball/purdue_boilermakers), [Penn State](team://ncaa_basketball/penn_st_nittany_lions)\n\nBig 10 West: [Mizzou](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers), Illinois, Northwestern, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa\n\nUnder this scenario all regional rivalries remain in tact\n\nWhy is this good for [Mizzou](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers)? The [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12) seems to forget about schools not named Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Kansas (basketball). There is no television network, so [Mizzou's](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers) games are generally only regionally shown. There is Big Monday for basketball, but that is mainly reserved for Texas and KU. Under this, [Mizzou's](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers) football games could be carried on the Big 10 Network and basketball games will be tied into the Big 10 ESPN deal. All this leads to a major recruiting advantage in both revenue generating sports.\n\n[Mizzou](team://ncaa_basketball/missouri_tigers) also has a rival in Illinois that would heat up instantly and the heated rivalry with Kansas will replace the Illinois basketball and football games on the schedules. Instead of St Louis, though, the KU games will be played at the Sprint Center and Arrowhead in KC.\n\nBut what about... [Iowa State](team://ncaa_basketball/iowa_st_cyclones)? The [Cyclones](team://ncaa_basketball/iowa_st_cyclones) seem to also be a natural fit and could easily add fuel to the rivalry with in-state foe [Iowa Hawkeyes](team://ncaa_basketball/iowa_hawkeyes) . The problem is that the Big 10 gains little from that arrangement. They are already pretty entrenched in the Hawkeye State and the addition of [ISU](team://ncaa_basketball/iowa_st_cyclones) wouldn't help their regional or national reputation.\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON JOINS THE BIG XII\n\nWhy is this good for the [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12)? The University of Houston is a large campus, in a region of Texas that is currently underdeveloped with college sports. Houston is the 4 th largest city in the country, and by planting a team there, the [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12) will get even more Texas viewership.\n\nThe big question would be on alignment, since there will now be 5 Texas schools. My proposal is for\n\n[Big 12 \"North](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12)\": Nebraska, Kansas, [Kansas State](team://ncaa_basketball/kansas_st_wildcats), [Iowa State](team://ncaa_basketball/iowa_st_cyclones), Oklahoma, [Oklahoma State](team://ncaa_basketball/oklahoma_st_cowboys)\n\n[Big 12 \"South](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12)\": Texas, Houston, [Texas Tech](team://ncaa_basketball/texas_tech_red_raiders), Texas A&amp;M, [Baylor](team://ncaa_basketball/baylor_bears), Colorado\n\nThe division names will have to be rebranded, but adding Colorado to the South is acceptable because Coloradoans joke that there are more [Texans](team://ncaa_basketball/tarleton_st_texans) in the state than natives.\n\nWhy is this good for Houston? Historically, the [Cougars](team://ncaa_basketball/washington_st_cougars) have had a good football team, and have won a basketball national championship. Having a Big XII logo on their court will increase their recruiting presence in the city and state and potentially turn them into powerhouse.\n\nBut what about... [TCU](team://ncaa_basketball/tcu_horned_frogs)? [TCU](team://ncaa_basketball/tcu_horned_frogs) would be a good choice, if they were bigger. Their 8000 student just wouldn't cut it if the conference wishes to remain the [BIG 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12). &nbsp;Houston's enrollment is approximately 30,000 students. Commuter school or not, Houston would help retain the \"Big\" in [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12).\n\nBYU AND UTAH GO TO THE [PAC-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10)\n\nWhy is this good for the [Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10)? By including Utah and BYU into the [Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10), the conference will have the 12 schools needed for an automatic conference championship games. Both programs have historically legitimate football and basketball programs, and they will bring their rivalry with them. Geographically, they are far enough West to warrant admission into the conference.\n\nThe division would be as follows\n\n[Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10) North: Washington, [Washington State](team://ncaa_basketball/washington_st_cougars), Oregon, [Oregon State](team://ncaa_basketball/oregon_st_beavers), BYU, Utah\n\n[Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10) South: Arizona, [Arizona State](team://ncaa_basketball/arizona_st_sun_devils), California, Stanford, [UCLA](team://ncaa_basketball/ucla_bruins), [USC](team://ncaa_basketball/usc_trojans)\n\nWhy is this good for BYU and Utah? Both recruit well from the West, and inclusion into the conference will aid that. And by coming over as a pair (and as rivals) they bring legitimacy to the expansion eastward.\n\nBut what about... geography? The state of Utah doesn't border any states of current [Pac-10](conference://ncaa_basketball/pac_10) members, and that may cause some issues, but distance isn't really something the conference has ever regarded. Consider that Tucson, AZ to Seattle, WA is 1100 miles, or 400 miles farther than Tucson to Provo, UT.\n\nADD MORE TEAMS TO THE MOUNTAIN WEST\n\nWhy is this good for the Mountain West? As it stands under this scenario, the Mountain West is down to 7 members (the current 9, minus BYU and Utah). To get up with the big boys, the MWC needs to add 5 schools. The 5 that should move to the MWC should be: [Boise State](team://ncaa_basketball/boise_st_broncos), Nevada, [New Mexico State](team://ncaa_basketball/new_mexico_st_aggies), Rice, SMU.\n\nThere is already talk of Boise coming over to the MWC, so that is a no brainer. The others are coming over as \"rivals\" to existing MWC schools. Nevada will face UNLV, [New Mexico State](team://ncaa_basketball/new_mexico_st_aggies) will pair with New Mexico, Rice and SMU will pit against [TCU](team://ncaa_basketball/tcu_horned_frogs) is a three-way battle for Texas.\n\nHaving 12 schools will allow the conference to host a championship game, matching the winners of each division, which would be as follows:\n\nMWC North: UNLV, Nevada, Air Force, Wyoming, Colorado State, [Boise State](team://ncaa_basketball/boise_st_broncos)\n\nMWC South: [San Diego State](team://ncaa_basketball/san_diego_st_aztecs), New Mexico, [New Mexico State](team://ncaa_basketball/new_mexico_st_aggies), [TCU](team://ncaa_basketball/tcu_horned_frogs), Rice, SMU\n\nWhy is this good for the 5 programs? The shift from either the C-USA or WAC will legitimize the programs (see the next point). All will also enter the new MWC with a foe. Everyone wins.\n\nBut what about... the MWC still remaining relatively minute as compared to their BCS brethren? Why would these schools shift from one conference to another, just for shits and giggles? See next point.\n\nADMIT THE MOUNTAIN WEST INTO THE BCS\n\nWhy is this good for the BCS? Controversy will mainly be avoided. By admitting the redesigned MWC into the BCS you are accepting the current BCS gate crashers. You are bringing in the current at-large schools causing heartache and giving yourself another conference champion that the country can latch onto.\n\nWhy is this good for the MWC? Why isn't it good for the MWC?\n\nBut what about... the C-USA and WAC? These two conferences are now in shambles. What to do? See next item.\n\nMERGE THE C-USA AND WAC\n\nWhy is this good for the two conferences? Because of the success of some of their schools, and regional ability to move, the [Conference USA](conference://ncaa_basketball/conference_usa) and WAC are currently left in shambles (under this proposal). Essentially afterthoughts as they are, now they are left with 15 schools between them. They could either split them up 8 and 7 or combine forces and form a 15 league mega conference. In terms of basketball, as we have seen with the [Big East](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_east), and their 16 school hoops conference, too many schools doesn't water down the pool.\n\nBut what about... regionality? The C-USA is currently a conglomerate of throw-ins from around the country. Under this plan, that would just increase to a truly national conference. The members of it would be: Fresno St, Hawaii, Idaho, La Tech, San Jose St, Utah St, UTEP, [Tulane](team://ncaa_basketball/tulane_green_wave), Tulsa, UAB, Cent Florida, ECU, Marshall, Memphis, [Southern Miss](team://ncaa_basketball/southern_miss_golden_eagles)\n\nUsing the scenario outlined above, 18 schools will change conferences. This sounds like a lot, but as you can see many will be moving as groups and either with or to a rival.\n\nBut what about the [Big East](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_east)? Well, the [Big East](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_east) is the one conference I am leaving alone. In their football world, they are lacking the 12 members to create a championship game. But when you include their basketball members, they are a 16-team powerhouse.\n\nOne final thought. I reserve the right to claim this entire scenario null and void if Notre Dame ever decides to join the Big 10. If that were to happen, I would still endorse some shifting, but nothing to the extent of this proposal. More on that if a Notre Dame to the Big 10 rumor starts getting some legitimate traction.", "entityStat.hotnessDebug"=>"view_count: raw: 0, score: 0.0000, avg: 3.1892, stddev: 10.3158; |comment_count: raw: 0, score: None, avg: 0.0001, stddev: 0.0139; |shares: raw: 0, score: None, avg: 0.0000, stddev: 0.0000; |item_count: raw: 0, score: None, avg: 0.0000, stddev: 0.0000; |fans: raw: 0, score: None, avg: 0.0000, stddev: 0.0000; |total_votes: raw: 0, score: None, avg: 0.0003, stddev: 0.0175; | totals: avg 0.0, absolute 126913755, adjusted 20", "entityStat.hotnessAbsolute"=>126913755, "entityStat.fanCount"=>0, "entity.resourcePath"=>"/ncaa_basketball/2009/12/15/in_a_perfect_world_conference_realignment", "entity.id"=>"6d870dfa-2c5e-5d99-90fa-7aafeb4e3c4c", "score"=>1.0, "rssFeed.name"=>"St. John's Red Storm", "article.type"=>"rss", "origin.name"=>"SB Nation", "entityStat.viewCount"=>0}, {"entityStat.rating"=>-1, "entity.name"=>"AP hoops poll for Dec. 14", "article.link"=>"http://blog.newsok.com/johnrohde/2009/12/15/ap-hoops-poll-for-dec-14/", "entity.displayDateRecency"=>"7 hours ago", "origin.resource"=>"origin://news_ok", "rssFeed.resource"=>"source://news_ok/john_rohde", "rssFeed.type"=>"columnists", "entityStat.hotness"=>"69", "rssFeed.id"=>"4db1e6be-55f3-5373-8268-47df85c9ef24", "entityStat.upvotes"=>0, "entityStat.downvotes"=>0, "entity.resource"=>"article://ncaa_basketball/2009/12/15/ap_hoops_poll_for_dec_14", "rssFeed.url"=>"http://blog.newsok.com/johnrohde/feed/", "rssFeed.level"=>"all", "origin.id"=>"6657a7a2-fb83-5ad2-b626-e9b38fc41d2a", "entityStat.commentCount"=>0, "entity.type"=>"article", "entity.lang"=>"EN", "entity.displayDate"=>Tue Dec 15 19:39:31 UTC 2009, "docType"=>"article", "article.summary"=>"The [Big 12](conference://ncaa_basketball/big_12) added another team to this week's Associated Press Top 25 poll in [Kansas State](team://ncaa_basketball/kansas_st_wildcats).
